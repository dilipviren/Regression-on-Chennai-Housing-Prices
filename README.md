Linear Regression Analysis on Chennai city land and buildings

Introduction: -
In this project we will try to determine the relationship between the price of a house in Chennai
and certain quantitative explanatory variables. Housing prices in Chennai vary greatly between locations. (Adyar, Anna Nagar, Chromepet, Karapakkam, KK Nagar, T Nagar, Velachery). It is in our interest to have an effective predictor of housing prices which is versatile enough to
cover most of these areas.
We also want to determine the extent and nature of the relationships between the study variable and the explanatory variables, both individually and as a whole. Additionally, we will attempt to examine the linearity or non-linearity of the relationships between the aforementioned variables.
❖ Regression analysis includes the following steps
▪ Statement of the problem under consideration ▪ Choice of relevant variables.
▪ Collection of data on relevant variables.
▪ Specification of model.
▪ Choice of method for fitting the data.
▪ Fitting of model.
▪ Model validation and criticism.
▪ Using the chosen model(s) for the solution of the posed problem.
❖ Data Collection Process:
We have used the website Kaggle to obtain the data. The data contains 5000 observations and
the original dataset can be viewed and downloaded at:

Selection of Regression Model
Linear models play a central part in modern statistical methods. These models are able to approximate a large amount of metric data structures in their entire range of definition.
Here we use Multiple Linear regression Model.
